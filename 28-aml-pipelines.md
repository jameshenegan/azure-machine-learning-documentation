https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines

### **Detailed Summary: Azure Machine Learning Pipelines**

## **Overview**

An **Azure Machine Learning (ML) pipeline** is an **automated, multistep workflow** used to manage the **end-to-end** machine learning lifecycle. These pipelines help **standardize best practices**, **improve scalability**, and **increase efficiency** in model development and deployment.

### **Key Benefits of Azure ML Pipelines:**

âœ… **Standardized MLOps practices** for better collaboration.  
âœ… **Increased training efficiency & cost reduction** by reusing unchanged steps.  
âœ… **Scalability across teams** using modular pipeline components.  
âœ… **Flexible execution** using different compute resources for different tasks.

## **1. Why Are Azure Machine Learning Pipelines Needed?**

### ðŸ”¹ **1.1 Modular Workflow for Machine Learning Tasks**

Instead of running an entire machine learning task in one go, pipelines **split the process into multiple steps**, each with **well-defined inputs and outputs**. Azure ML automatically **orchestrates dependencies** between steps.

### ðŸ”¹ **1.2 Standardizing MLOps Practices & Enabling Team Collaboration**

ML pipelines help **automate model development and deployment**, allowing different teams to work independently:

- **Data Engineers** â†’ Focus on **data collection & preparation**
- **Data Scientists** â†’ Work on **model training & evaluation**
- **ML Engineers** â†’ Handle **deployment & automation**

Azure ML **components (v2)** allow users to define **self-contained code snippets** for specific tasks in the pipeline, making the entire process **reusable and versioned**.

### ðŸ”¹ **1.3 Enhancing Training Efficiency & Reducing Costs**

- **Reuses Outputs:** Avoids re-executing steps that remain unchanged across experiments.
- **Optimized Compute:** Runs **data-heavy tasks** on **high-memory CPUs** and **model training** on **GPUs**, optimizing cost and performance.

Example: A **natural language processing (NLP) model** that requires:

- **Data preprocessing** on a CPU cluster.
- **Model training** on a GPU-based cluster.

Using an ML pipeline ensures that compute resources are **efficiently allocated** to different tasks.

## **2. Getting Started with Azure ML Pipelines**

### ðŸ”¹ **2.1 First-Time Pipeline Implementation**

For teams new to ML pipelines:

1. **Refactor ML code** â†’ Remove unnecessary code, **parameterize inputs**.
2. **Break training code into steps** â†’ Define components for **data prep, training, and evaluation**.
3. **Perform unit tests** for each step.
4. **Combine steps into a pipeline** for automation and tracking.

### ðŸ”¹ **2.2 Scaling with Reusable Pipeline Templates**

Once familiar with ML pipelines, teams can:

- Create **templates** for specific ML workflows.
- Assign different team members to build **pipeline components**.
- Run and automate pipelines after **structuring their code**.

### ðŸ”¹ **2.3 Advanced Productivity with Reusable Components**

As teams **build multiple pipelines**, they can:

- **Clone previous pipelines** or reuse **prebuilt components**.
- Store commonly used **models, components, and environments** in an **Azure ML registry**.
