### **Detailed Summary: What are Azure Machine Learning Pipelines?**

### **Overview**

Azure Machine Learning pipelines provide an **automated, modular, and scalable** way to orchestrate machine learning (ML) workflows. They break down a complex ML process into **manageable steps**, making it easier to **standardize, automate, and optimize** model training and deployment.

## **1. Why Are Azure Machine Learning Pipelines Needed?**

### **Key Benefits of ML Pipelines**

1. **Standardizing MLOps & Team Collaboration**

   - MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) automates ML workflows.
   - Pipelines allow different teams to work on **specific steps independently**:
     - **Data Engineers** â†’ Data collection & preprocessing.
     - **Data Scientists** â†’ Model training & evaluation.
     - **ML Engineers** â†’ Deployment & automation.
   - Uses **Azure ML Components (v2)**: Self-contained code snippets for each step.
   - Enables **versioning and automation**, making ML projects more **repeatable**.

2. **Improving Training Efficiency & Reducing Cost**
   - **Avoids redundant reprocessing** by detecting unchanged steps and **reusing previous outputs**.
   - Supports **running each step on different compute resources**:
     - **High-memory CPU** for data preprocessing.
     - **Expensive GPUs** only for model training.
   - Optimizing compute resource allocation **significantly reduces costs**.

## **2. Getting Started: Best Practices**

### **Approaches to Building ML Pipelines**

1. **Basic Transition to Pipelines**

   - Start with existing **local** training scripts or notebooks.
   - Convert them into **modular pipeline steps**.
   - Parameterize data inputs & outputs.
   - Run **unit tests** on each step before integrating them into a full pipeline.

2. **Pipeline Templates for Scalability**

   - Set up **predefined pipeline templates** (e.g., templates for classification, regression, etc.).
   - Teams work on **assigned pipeline steps** independently.
   - Structured code ensures **easy execution & automation**.
   - Changes affect only individual pipeline steps, **not the entire pipeline**.

3. **Leveraging Reusable Components**
   - Once teams have **multiple ML pipelines**, they can:
     - Clone previous pipelines.
     - Combine **pre-built, reusable components**.
   - This **boosts productivity** and reduces development effort.

### **How to Build Pipelines in Azure ML**

Azure ML provides **multiple ways** to build pipelines:

- **For DevOps users** â†’ Use **Azure CLI**.
- **For Python developers** â†’ Use **Azure ML SDK v2**.
- **For non-programmers** â†’ Use **Azure ML Designer (UI-based approach)**.
