### **Detailed Summary of "Get Started with RAG Using a Prompt Flow Sample (Preview)"**

#### **Overview**

This tutorial guides users on how to implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in **Azure Machine Learning (AML)** using a **prompt flow sample**. A **prompt** is an input command or query provided to an AI model to generate a response, and the process of designing effective prompts is known as **prompt engineering**.

The **prompt flow** in Azure Machine Learning is an interactive tool for managing **prompt engineering projects**. By following this guide, users can learn how to use **Vector Index** in a **prompt flow** to enhance AI-generated responses.

> **Note:**  
> This feature is in **public preview** and should not be used for production workloads as some features may be limited or unsupported.
