### **Detailed Summary of "Vector Stores in Azure Machine Learning (Preview)"**

#### **Overview**

This article discusses the implementation of **vector indexes** in Azure Machine Learning (AML) to support **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows. Vector indexes store **embeddings**, which are numerical representations of data concepts, enabling **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT-4 to understand relationships between different data points. These vector stores help efficiently retrieve supplemental data for enhancing LLM outputs.

Currently, Azure Machine Learning supports **two types of vector stores**:

1. **Faiss (Open Source)**
2. **Azure AI Search (PaaS Resource)**

Both options cater to different needs, from development and testing to enterprise-scale deployments.

### **Faiss Library (Open Source Vector Store)**

**Faiss** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library that provides a **local file-based** vector store. This option is cost-effective and primarily used for **development and testing**.

#### **Key Features of Faiss in Azure Machine Learning**

- **Local Storage**: The vector index is stored in an Azure Storage Account within the AML workspace.
- **Minimal Costs**: No costs for index creation, only **storage expenses**.
- **Fast Querying**: Enables **in-memory index building and querying**.
- **Flexibility**: Indexes can be **shared** across different users or **hosted** in an application.
- **Scalability**: Uses compute power to load and process large vector indexes efficiently.

Faiss is ideal for **low-cost, experimental, and local vector processing** where cloud-scale indexing isn't required.

### **Azure AI Search (Enterprise-Scale Vector Store)**

**Azure AI Search** (formerly known as **Cognitive Search**) is a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** resource designed for large-scale vector storage and retrieval.

#### **Key Features of Azure AI Search**

- **Enterprise-Level Capabilities**: Offers **scalability, security, and high availability** for business applications.
- **Hybrid Information Retrieval**:
  - Stores **both vector and text data** in search indexes.
  - Supports **semantic reranking and hybrid search** (combining traditional text search with vector-based similarity search).
- **Supports Large Datasets**: A **single search service** can host multiple vector indexes.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with **prompt flows** in Azure Machine Learning to automate vector creation, storage, and retrieval.

#### **Current Limitations (Preview Feature)**

- Vectors **must be generated externally** and then uploaded to Azure AI Search for indexing.
- **Query encoding and similarity search** require Azure AI Search integration.
- The **prompt flow feature automates** the vector indexing and retrieval process.

Azure AI Search is well-suited for **enterprise applications requiring large-scale, hybrid search capabilities**.

### **Using Vector Stores in Azure Machine Learning**

To integrate **vector stores** into an **Azure Machine Learning prompt flow**, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a vector store** (Faiss for local use, Azure AI Search for enterprise needs).
2. **Prepare the data**:
   - Convert raw text into **embeddings** using an embedding model.
   - Store embeddings in **vector indexes**.
3. **Query the vector store**:
   - Use **Faiss** for in-memory searches (local vector matching).
   - Use **Azure AI Search** for hybrid search (combining vector and text retrieval).
4. **Connect to the prompt flow**:
   - Define the vector index in AML.
   - Generate vectors from source data.
   - Store and retrieve vectors efficiently for LLM processing.
